    "\n",
    "ChemCluster is a streamlined and interactive platform designed to facilitate the analysis and visualization of chemical datasets using molecular clustering techniques. It leverages the power of **RDKit** for cheminformatics and **Streamlit** for web interface deployment, offering an intuitive solution for researchers and students alike.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two main modes of operation are supported by the platform:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dataset Mode**: This mode allows users to upload datasets (in `.sdf`, `.mol` or `.csv` format) containing multiple molecular structures.  The molecules are processed to compute their key physicochemical descriptors, then clustered based on these properties. The resulting clusters are visualized interactively, and users can explore individual structures along with their 2D/3D representations and calculated properties.\n",
    "- **Single Molecule Mode**: In this workflow, ChemCluster generates a set of conformers for a single input molecule. These conformers are clustered based on structural similarity, and representative structures are visualized in  3D, enabling users to analyze conformational diversity effectively."

    "## 1. Setup and Initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin using ChemCluster, you have two options: installation via PyPI or running the application locally from source.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Installation from PyPI\n",
    "The simplest way to install ChemCluster is through the Python Package Index. In a terminal or command prompt, run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash \n",
    "pip install chemcluster \n",
    "``` \n",
    "\n",
    "Once installed, you can launch the application by executing:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "chemcluster\n",
    "```\n",
    "This command will open the ChemCluster interface directly in your default web browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Running Locally from Source (for Development or Contribution)\n",
    "If you prefer to contribute to the project or wish to run it locally in a development environment, follow these steps:\n",
    "1. Clone the repository from GitHub:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/erubbia/ChemCluster\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. Navigate into the project directory:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd ChemCluster\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. Create a conda environment based on the project's environment file:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda env create -f environment.yml\n",
    "```\n",
    "4. Activate the newly created environment:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda activate chemcluster-env\n",
    "```\n",
    "5. Finally, install the project in editable mode:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install -e .\n",
    "```\n",
    "After this setup, you can launch ChemCluster the same way by running `chemcluster` in the terminal."

    "\n",
    "ChemCluster has proven to be a functional and user-friendly cheminformatics platform for exploring molecular structures and clusters through RDKit and Streamlit. The application allows both single-molecule and dataset-based analyses, including conformer generation, clustering, property calculation, 2D/3D visualization, and interactive selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "The project successfully integrates key aspects of molecular analysis into a cohesive, visual, and reproducible workflow. It has been used to process real molecular inputs such as flavone, and demonstrates clear separation of molecular clusters, meaningful descriptor distributions, and smooth user interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the main functionalities are complete and operational, additional features were considered during the development process. These include more advanced modeling or solution-phase interaction analysis, which were postponed in favor of keeping the application focused, functional, and robust.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future Perspective\n",
    "\n",
    "A promising extension could be the visualization of hydrogen bonding interactions between different centroid conformers of a given molecule in solution. This would help investigate the possible over- or underestimation of transition states (TS) depending on conformer environments. Although this idea was not implemented in the final version, it remains a valuable direction for future work.\n"
